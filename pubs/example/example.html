        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <div class="content has-text-justified">
The "computable" numbers may be described briefly as the real
numbers whose expressions as a decimal are calculable by finite means.
Although the subject of this paper is ostensibly the computable numbers.
it is almost equally easy to define and investigate computable functions
of an integral variable or a real or computable variable, computable
predicates, and so forth. The fundamental problems involved are,
however, the same in each case, and I have chosen the computable numbers
for explicit treatment as involving the least cumbrous technique. I hope
shortly to give an account of the relations of the computable numbers,
functions, and so forth to one another. This will include a development
of the theory of functions of a real variable expressed in terms of computable
numbers. According to my definition, a number is computable
if its decimal can be written down by a machine...

<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>The paper &quot;On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem&quot; was published by Alan Turing in 1936. In this groundbreaking paper, Turing introduced the concept of a universal computing machine, now known as the Turing machine.</p>
<h2 id="objective">Objective</h2>
<p>Turing's main objective in this paper was to investigate the notion of computability and its relation to the Entscheidungsproblem (the decision problem), which is concerned with determining whether a given mathematical statement is provable or not.</p>
<h2 id="key-ideas">Key Ideas</h2>
<ol>
<li>Turing first presented the concept of a &quot;computable number,&quot; which refers to a number that can be computed by an algorithm or a definite step-by-step process.</li>
<li>He introduced the notion of a Turing machine, an abstract computational device consisting of an infinite tape divided into cells and a read-write head. The machine can read and write symbols on the tape, move the head left or right, and transition between states based on a set of rules.</li>
<li>Turing demonstrated that the set of computable numbers is enumerable, meaning it can be listed in a systematic way, even though it is not necessarily countable.</li>
<li>He proved the existence of non-computable numbers, which cannot be computed by any Turing machine.</li>
<li>Turing showed that the Entscheidungsproblem is undecidable, meaning there is no algorithm that can determine, for any given mathematical statement, whether it is provable or not.</li>

<p>He used the concept of a universal Turing machine to prove that the set of computable functions is recursively enumerable, meaning it can be listed by an algorithm.</p>
<h2 id="significance">Significance</h2>
<p>Turing's paper laid the foundation for the theory of computation and had a profound impact on the development of computer science. The Turing machine became a fundamental concept in theoretical computer science, serving as a theoretical model for studying the limits and capabilities of computation. Turing's work also influenced the development of programming languages, algorithms, and the design of modern computers.</p>
